      <p>
        Lindenhurst Launchpad provides students in the community with an alumni network who are 
        passionate about helping them succeed in high school and beyond. Navigating the endless 
        opportunities that exist upon high school graduation can be overwhelming, but our alumni 
        are here to help ease that stress for students. We host events and workshops, award scholarships, 
        and provide mentoring opportunities, all designed to contribute to the growth of our community&#39;s young minds.
